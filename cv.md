### About Me

---

I'm learn to be developer _(at the moment to be junior front end)_.
<br>

For many years I have keen to technologies and was reading from time to time news about what new happened in IT field, discussing this with my friends who have similar interest or working as developers. I recently decided to dedicate myself entirely to the course and learn how to program.
<br>

My main interest lies in creative outlet of development: making new tools of expression for people; working with sound and visuals; making websites. _(but also, I still thinks about backend dev. and to be a "full stack". I want to find company that making their own product. I want to have not a narrower role, but a wide range of tasks.)_
