I'm learn to be developer (at the moment junior front end). For many years I have keen to technologies and was reading from time to time news about what new happened in IT field, discusing that with my friends who have similiar interest or working as SWD. Recently I fully decide to try and learn by a cource. My main interest relies in creative outlet of development: making new tools of expression for people; working with sound and visuals; making websites. (but also, I still thinks about backend dev. and to be a "full stack". I want to find company that making theyr own product and maybe work on that prodcut more then to have a solid role in just one field.)
